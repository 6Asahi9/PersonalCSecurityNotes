This room covered various principles and concepts related to security. By now, you should be very familiar with CIA and DAD and other terms such as authenticity, repudiation, vulnerability, threat, and risk. We visited three security models and the ISO/IEC 19249. We have covered different security principles such as defence in depth, trust but verify, and zero trust.

Finally, the Shared Responsibility Model is worth mentioning, especially with the increased reliance on cloud services. Various aspects are required to ensure proper security. They include hardware, network infrastructure, operating systems, applications, etc. However, customers using cloud services have different access levels depending on the cloud services they use. For example, an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) user has complete control (and responsibility) over the operating system.

On the other hand, a Software as a Service (SaaS) user has no direct access to the underlying operating system. Consequently, achieving security in a cloud environment necessitates both the cloud service provider and the user to do their parts. The Shared Responsibility Model is a cloud security framework to ensure that each party is aware of its responsibility.

Having finished the Security Principles room, you may proceed to the Intro to Cryptography room.
